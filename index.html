									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>Hello, my name is Mel Viator. I am a graduate student at Boston University, receiving a Master of Science in Applied Data Analytics. Thus far in my program, I have enjoyed studying machine learning methods, algorithm design and analysis, data mining, among other data science concepts. In addition to my studies, I work part-time as a Data Scientist Masters Student at the Veterans Health Administration where I perform analyses to support healthcare professionals with research projects. From my education and work experience, I have developed a strong background in Python, R, Java, and SQL. I am especially interested in data science applications in the healthcare sector, as seen in a couple of my data science projects below. This portfolio summarizes a few data science projects I have created throughout my time as a graduate student.</p>

										<h2>DNA Sequence Classification with CNN</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/dna.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I applied deep learning techniques to accurately classify DNA sequences labeled as positive or negative for histone occupancy. I used Keras to implement two neural networks: a CNN and a hybrid CNN-LSTM. For each model, I experimented with two encoding methods - one-hot encoding and k-mers encoding - to embed the DNA sequences into the neural networks. By experimenting with various preprocessing techniques, models, and hyperparameters, I compared the effectiveness of the models in classifying the DNA sequences with 81% - 85% accuracy. The CNN-LSTM model had a higher accuracy than the simple CNN model, demonstrating the benefits of an RNN component to understand the sequence's dependences.</p>

										<h2>Understanding the Shortest Path Problem</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/graph.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I conducted extensive research on the shortest path problem, an infamous problem in graph theory that aims to find the optimal paths among a network of vertices in a graph. I found that while Dijkstra's algorithm successfully finds the shortest path, the time complexity is extremely inefficient - runtime of O(E*logV). Contrastingly, Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) has a time complexity that is asymptotically superior to Dijkstra. However, RRT alone does not necessarily find the optimal path. To overcome the limitations of these algorithms, I proposed and implemented the combination of RRT + Dijkstra to solve the shortest path problem in a practical runtime that takes approximately 208M fewer iterations than Dijkstra's algorithm.</p>

										<h2>Workplace Gender Discrimination Analysis</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/gender.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I extracted a dataset from a gender discrimination case against a university to analyze and conduct inferences about gender pay and promotion inequalities. I implemented statistical hypotheses, confidence intervals, multiple regression models, and other statistical analyses in R to understand three research areas: 1) the population mean salary differences between genders, 2) variables that are the most significant predictors for salary, and 3) the proportion of full professors that are male versus female. I uncovered a notable inequality between the proportion of male and female full professors (20% - 40% lower), resulting in the likelihood that females have a salary approximately $44K - $73K lower than their male counter parts.</p>

										<h2>NLP Keyword Extraction with BERT</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/keyword.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I used BERT, a pre-train deep bidirectional encoder transformer, to implement NLP techniques on TED Talk videos. First, I executed the self-supervised framework, Wav2vec, to convert the videos into a text transcript. Next, I used the KeyBERT package to extract meaningful keywords from 1) the full TED Talk video transcript and 2) a summary of the TED Talk video. To analyze the results of the NLP techniques, I calculated the cosine similarity to better understand the accuracy of the 'BERT keywords' in comparison to 'human keywords.' The BERT keywords derived from the full transcript yielded the best results with 74% - 82% accuracy, highlighting algorithm's ability to consider the semantic aspects of the full text document.</p>

										<h2>ML Classification of Breast Cancer Tumors</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/tumor.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I researched and reproduced machine learning classification models to accurately predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on a set of features collected from an imaging test. I began by exploring the dataset composed of features from the imaging test to understand the distribution and multicollinearity of the variables. Next, I utilized Sklearn and Keras to develop three machine learning classifiers - Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks - and determined which model is most effective in predicting the classification of a tumor. My analysis found that the ANN classifier had the highest sensitivity (TPR = 97%), accurately predicting malignant tumors.</p>

										<h2>Analysis of World Happiness</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/world.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I utilized a dataset from the World Happiness Report to analyze countries' happiness levels and the potential factors that influence happiness. I examined the regions included in the dataset and how the ladder score, a measurement of an individual's happiness level, evolved over a fifteen-year time period. I analyzed the potential factors that could predict a country's ladder score based on correlation and multiple linear regression models. Additionally, I tested the central limit theorem and various sampling methods to understand how sampling would affect the distribution of the dataset. I developed this project in R for statistical computing and graphics to communicate the results with visual representations.</p>
